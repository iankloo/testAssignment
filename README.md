# testAssignment

Here is a test assignment!  Write some code and submit it...

This section is a basic markdown document, so we can provide code instructions (including any code blocks, images, etc.) right here.

## How to submit an assigment

1. Click "Fork" at the top right of this page.  This creates a version of the respository that you own.

2. Make changes to the files in your forked respository.  You can either use the GUI on github, or clone the repository to your local machine, make edits, and push them back.

3. Come back to the original repository, click "New Pull Request" on the top left of the page.  Submit your pull request to turn in the assignment.
